# Bubble-Point-Pressure-and-Oil-formation-factor-Prediction-using-ML
This repository contain csv, jupyter files of the ML code to predict Bubble Point Pressure and Oil formation factor  
### Aim
- Accurate predictions of Bubble point pressure and Oil formation Volume Factor is crucial to predicting these attributes as they are critical in designing and maintaining a Gas reservoir.
- The current correlation metrics used to calculate these attributes are standoff, markoff, glasso correlations which have few limitations in accuracy when the fluid properties are not within its accuracy thesholds(i.e above certain temperatures, high specific gravity fluids etc).
### Dataset description
- The dataset contains almost 600 instances and 7 features among which BPP and OFVF are target variable so the rest 5 features are input features.

### Results
- A comparision of all the models gives us an undestanding of their performaces which are measeured my metrics like rmse and R2 scores.
